# PubMedCLIP in Medical Visual Question Answering

This repository includes PubMedCLIP, the fine-tuned version of CLIP with ROCO image--caption pairs. We also provide the pipelines for encorporating PubMedCLIP as the alternative pre-trained visual encoder in [MEVF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11867) and [QCR](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3394171.3413761?casa_token=E_IrwKfXPEMAAAAA:IC1Epmj0HbdWYzZWUfPpjbBJuMuL-iTdGbe1kVr5UQ4iVvfTgN_mgDBBEjyhqNBzRanKKlzyVQ) medical visual question answering pipelines. Our experiments illustrate that PubMedCLIP results in up tp 3% improvement in the medical visual question answering.
